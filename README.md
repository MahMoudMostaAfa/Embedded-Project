# GPS Tracking System

### Description

The goal of this project is to develop an embedded system using C programming that gathers real-time positional coordinates while a microcontroller is in motion (GPS tracking system using TM4C123G LaunchPad) after power-on until a destination point is reached. The collected data will then be efficiently transferred to a personal computer (PC) and visualized on a map application.
